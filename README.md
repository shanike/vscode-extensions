## הנחות יסוד
- The command pallette (opened with `ctrl`+`shift`+`p`) has all commands (command that are bind to keyboard shortcuts and commands that are not)
- The extensions can be opened with `ctrl`+`shift`+`x`
- Intellisense is vs-code's completion menu that tries to complete your sentence (- your line of code)



## Extensions List:

> The names here are the exact names of the extensions in the vscode's extensions marketplace (`ctrl`+`shift`+`x` in vscode)


---
### IntelliCode
Comes from **Microsoft**. 

Adds intellisense which is created from data of millions of users. it guesses good...

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioExptTeam.vscodeintellicode

---
### Code Spell Checker
Will add a curly underline sign on words that are not spelled correctly. Helps prevent "typo"s

VERY SUGGESTED

> (even for english speakers)

> I once wrote a short doc about a certain function, and at the end I noticed (thanks to this extension) that I mis-spelled the word "function" three times, in THREE different ways in one paragraph.

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker

---
### TabOut

Use the `tab` key to get out of quotes, brackets, etc.

e.g if this: `|` is your cursor and you're here: `someFunc(value|)`. Without the extension, you need to press the `right-arrow` key. With the extension you would also be able to press the `tab` key. It's very intuitive once you try it (:

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=albert.TabOut

---
### To

---
### File Utils

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sleistner.vscode-fileutils

---
### javascript console utils
Adds a keyboard shortcut (default to `ctrl` + `shift` + `l`) which writes: `console.log()`. 
And when a variable is selected, writes `console.log(“var: “, var);`.

> There are several console.log extensions, you're welcome to find the one you prefer.

> You can also checkout how to do this on you own, using vscode's user configured keybindings and snippets

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=whtouche.vscode-js-console-utils

---

### Auto Add Brackets in String Interpolation
If you type a dollar sign (`$`) inside backtick brackets (` `` `) it will add the curly brackets for you

i.e ``` `typingHere` ``` -> writing a `$`: `$typingHere` -> will turn into ``` `${typingHere...}` ```

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aliariff.auto-add-brackets


---
### Auto rename tag

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag

---
### ES7 React/.../React-Native Snippet
Words or a combination of letters which you can write in your code and the VSCode Intellisense (_the menu trying to complete your sentences_) will provide you with options from the React Snippet library, which, when selected, will open (surprisingly) a SNIPPET.

\> *many combinations*. Check the extension docs.

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets

---

### Indent rainbow

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.Bookmarks

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dannyconnell.split-html-attributes

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ezforo.copy-relative-path-and-line-numbers


---

### Bracket Peek 
(TRY THIS!!!)
When your cursor is on or is hovered on a closing bracket, this extension will show you what the opening bracket looks like. e.g if there's a big and scoped function and your working somewhere in the middle, it'll show you what's going on in the _opening bracket_ your cursor (or hover) is on.

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jomeinaster.bracket-peek

---

### Svg Preview
... svg preview ... (right when you open a .svg file, it'll load the svg in a tab on your right)

---

### Theme by language
If you want your vscode Color Theme to change per file language (e.g ```.js```, ```.py```).
- you'll need to set it to what you want


---
### CSS peak
With the `ctrl` button pressed, hovering over an html/jsx className/class/id, a peek of the CSS code will appear.
